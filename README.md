# About

The Hangman game is a C# console-based game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word. The game provides visual feedback in the form of a hangman figure, which gradually appears as incorrect guesses are made. Players must guess all the letters in the word before the hangman figure is fully drawn to win. The program randomly selects a word from a dictionary and displays it as a series of underscores. If a guess is correct, the word is revealed, and if incorrect, the hangman figure is drawn.

# Features

The Hangman game in C# combines word guessing, visual feedback, and suspense to help players solve a hidden word. Players guess letters to reveal a hidden word, with the goal being to identify all the letters in the word. As players make incorrect guesses, a hangman figure gradually appears, representing their progress. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined dictionary, with the chosen word remaining hidden initially. The word is displayed as underscores, representing unknown letters in the word. When a player guesses a correct letter, it is revealed in the word, replacing the underscores with the correctly guessed letters. The game continues until the player guesses the entire word or the hangman is fully drawn.

Improvements include a user-friendly interface, input validation, and enhanced gameplay features like difficulty levels, scoring, and a larger word dictionary. Code organization could also be optimized for better readability and maintainability. Despite serving its purpose as a Hangman game, there's room for improvement to improve quality and user satisfaction.
